# DeathsBy

The DeathsBy project utilizes data from Death by Zip Codes in California, with a primary focus on the zip codes in the San Francisco Bay Area. The project focuses on the top 10 zip codes with the most deaths, and it examines which age group has the most deaths and what gender has the highest death rate in these zip codes during 2013-2016. The goal of the project was to see which areas in the San Francisco Bay Area have the most deaths and to understand what age group and which gender has the highest deaths.

The data shows that zip codes with older people (age group 75+) tend to have the most deaths. To extend this, we could find the zip codes with the most deaths of people under 35 and see how that differs from the current data. Additionally, the data shows that both genders tended to have around the same amount of deaths each year in the given zip codes.
